RABiTPy Pre-Walkthrough Setup and Troubleshooting Guide
=======================================================

This guide is meant to help users set up their environment **before** running the main RABiTPy walkthrough file. It is especially helpful for users who are new to Python or have encountered installation issues.

Follow these steps first to ensure that your system is ready to use RABiTPy smoothly.

---

1. Set Up a New Python Environment (Recommended)
------------------------------------------------

Using a separate environment helps avoid conflicts with other programs.

Step-by-step:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux)
2. Copy and paste the following commands one at a time:

conda create --name rabitpy_env python=3.10.11
conda activate rabitpy_env

This helps to install RABiTPy in a clean and safe space.

2. What to Do if You See: "No module named 'cv2'"
-------------------------------------------------

This means OpenCV (a package RABiTPy needs) isn't installed.

Try this first:

pip install opencv-python

If you're using a server or a computer without a screen, try:

pip install opencv-python-headless

Still not working? Try using Conda instead:

conda install -c conda-forge opencv

Then test again:

python
import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)

---

3. Tips for Avoiding Errors
---------------------------

- Always make sure your environment is activated: 
  conda activate rabitpy_env

- Don't mix too many OpenCV versions. Stick with one.
- If youâ€™re using an editor like VS Code or PyCharm, make sure it uses the environment you created.

---

4. When Nothing Else Works
--------------------------

Sometimes, the easiest fix is to start fresh.

Try deleting your old environment and starting again:

conda remove --name rabitpy_env --all
conda create --name rabitpy_env python=3.10.11
conda activate rabitpy_env

Thanks for trying out RABiTPy. Happy tracking!
